When creating this package, I thought to [google](https://lmgtfy.app) how far along [Ludum Dare](https://lmgtfy.app?q=ludum+dare) had come and it was bountiful as a new-comer attempting to field a challenge in code! I received a lot of critical feedback, but it helped me re-gather my original position a lot and I'm glad for all the enthusiastic support and Anonymous comments.



The purpose of this tool is to connect developers to game dev, blockchain, or any other API they'd anticipate being necessary during development of XYZ (podcast, dev tool, game, etc...). The original intent was the theme of Ludum Dare 47 and that of infinite loops, and other issues we run into when sending the [CANARY INTO THE COAL MINE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_species#:~:text=Canaries%20were%20iconically%20used%20in,them%20time%20to%20take%20action.)

## Installing

To install globally (recommended): `npm i -g @obrienk/orphic-cli`.

## Usage

If installed globally, invoke `orphic` via CLI and create a new base package with a template like JavaScript or TypeScript for git.
